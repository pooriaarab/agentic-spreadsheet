## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-29

First release.

### Added

- Workbook model on one Yjs document. Sheets have a set order. Cells are sparse.
- Every row and column has a stable id. Cells and formula refs use the ids, and A1 is a view.
- Insert, delete, and move rows and columns. Formula refs follow the moved cells.
- Formula engine with incremental recalculation and the error values `#REF!`, `#DIV/0!`,
  `#NAME?`, `#VALUE!`, `#NUM!`, `#N/A`, `#CIRCULAR`, and `#DEPTH!`.
- CSV import and export. Export marks text that could run as a formula.
- Every cell keeps the principal that last edited it.
- CLI (`agentic-spreadsheet`) and MCP server (`agentic-spreadsheet mcp`) over a local file store.
- HTTP API in a Cloudflare Worker under `/api/v1/sheets`. It needs an API key or the explicit
  `SHEETS_UNSAFE_TRUST_HEADERS=1` setting.
- Workbooks saved by an older version with A1 keys convert when they load.

### Known limits

- The Worker keeps workbooks in memory. A restart loses them.
- XLSX and ODS import and export are not built yet.
- The CLI and the MCP server do not check the caller. `--as` and `--kind` are labels.

See the README for the full list of limits.
